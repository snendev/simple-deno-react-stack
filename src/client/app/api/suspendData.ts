/**
 * suspendData is a simple in-render reader for remote data.
 * It works with the above cache to process async work through the AsyncRef class.
 * This code is written for demonstrative purposes, and forks should replace this with react-query
 * or a similar recommended and Suspense-integrated data solution.
 *
 * Rather than caching every Response or whatever type, the user must simply clarify how to yield
 * a "resolved" response.
 * Since React could suspend and re-try rendering at any time, it is critical that there is no way
 * to call e.g. some Response.body.text() stream more than once.
 * This is a pretty hard API choice to make as a library maintainer, since it is hard to steer
 * users away from incorrect usage, so I sympathize with the react-fetch team.
 * But I'm ignoring this problem.
 *
 * There's also no cache lock here, so keys should be unique per usage of suspendData -- it is
 * less concerning to consider only the race between a component and its next render.
